        <p className="mb-3">
            After graduating at Mather High School,{" "}
            I decided to continue into programming as I had taken{" "} 
            web development classes previously.I enrolled in Illinois Institute of Technology{" "}
            as an ITM web development major. I was able to learn many different{" "} 
            types of programming languages. I love the{" "} 
            feeling of being able to create and design my own website. My strongest skills{" "} 
            are in <span className="font-medium">HTML and CSS.</span>{" "}
            I am also familiar with JavaScript and always willing to learn new programming languages.{" "} 
        </p>

        <p>
        When I'm not busy with school work, I'm spending time with{" "} 
        my guinea pigs, Darwin and Remy. I also play video games whenever I have time.{" "}
